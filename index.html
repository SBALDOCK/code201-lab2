      <p>Hi there everyone. My name is Steve. I grew up in a household full of music and it has played a significant role in my life since the first time I picked up an instrument. My parents were both music teachers in my small home town. It was such a small school district that I had one of the two of them as a teacher every year from the time I was in first grade until I graduated from high school. </p>
      <p>
        I started off playing brass instruments and spent much of my time learning the trumpet, trombone, tuba and euphonium. 
      </p>
